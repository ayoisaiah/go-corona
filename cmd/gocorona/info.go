COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus called coronavirus.

[ How it spreads ](fg:white,bg:yellow,fg:bold)

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

[ Symptoms ](fg:white,bg:yellow,fg:bold)

The main symptoms of coronavirus are:
ðŸ‘‰ a high temperature â€“ this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature).
ðŸ‘‰ a new, continuous cough â€“ this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual).

You can usually treat mild coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms at home. If your symptoms are severe, you may need medical care until you recover.

[ Prevention ](fg:white,bg:yellow,fg:bold)

To help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), avoid close contact with anyone you do not live with and wash your hands regularly.

To stop the spread of coronavirus, you should:
ðŸ‘‰ wear a face mask when you are outdoors.
ðŸ‘‰ wash your hands with soap and water often â€“ for at least 20 seconds.
ðŸ‘‰ wash your hands as soon as you get home.
ðŸ‘‰ cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
ðŸ‘‰ put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands.
ðŸ‘‰ not touch your face if your hands are not clean.
